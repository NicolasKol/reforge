# scripts

Experimental notebooks for ad-hoc analysis, testing, and thesis-specific evaluations.

## Notebooks

| Notebook | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `EXEC_builder_test.ipynb` | Execute builder pipeline programmatically |
| `EXEC_experiment_config.ipynb` | Execute experiment configuration and runs |
| `TEST_case_analysis.ipynb` | Individual test case deep-dive |
| `TEST_function_trajectories.ipynb` | Function behavior across optimization levels |
| `TEST_thesis_analysis.ipynb` | Thesis benchmark analysis and figure generation |

EXEC notebooks provide programmatic pipeline execution as an alternative to API calls via curl or browser. TEST notebooks are for exploratory analysis. For reproducible pipeline evaluation, see `data/results/PIPELINE_*.ipynb` notebooks.
