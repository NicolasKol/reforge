    "## The Big Picture: Survivorship Bias in Yield Rates\n",
    "\n",
    "The single most important insight is that **the yield rate % is misleading in isolation** because both the numerator (HC count) and denominator (eligible count) change across optimization levels. Several test cases show counterintuitive yield *increases* at higher optimization — but this is always because **the optimizer eliminates the hard-to-match functions from the eligible pool**, leaving only the easy ones.\n",

    "**What happens mechanically:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **O0 failures** — `abs_val`, `clamp`, `max2` are `static inline` 1-line helpers from recurse.h (e.g., `return x < 0 ? -x : x`). They're included in 3 translation units, so DWARF has 3 copies of each. The compiled code is identical across TUs, so the alignment finds 3 candidates with perfect overlap → **AMBIGUOUS**. The pipeline correctly refuses to pick one.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **O1 failures** — At `-O1`, the inline helpers get inlined into their callers. But the recursive functions (`fibonacci`, `tree_sum`, `tree_depth`) now have **scattered DWARF line info** because the inlined helper code mixes with the caller's code. The alignment finds 4 candidates with only ~76-83% overlap → qw = overlap/n_candidates ≈ 0.19-0.21 → too low for GOLD.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **O2/O3 \"100%\"** — The compiler aggressively inlines everything except `main`. All recursive functions lose their DWARF address ranges (they become `DW_TAG_inlined_subroutine` entries without standalone ranges → NO_RANGE → NON_TARGET). The eligible pool collapses to just `main`, which passes trivially. The 5-6 anonymous DWARF entries that appear are compiler-generated clones/outlines from optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bottom line:** The 100% yield at O2/O3 represents **1 function**, not a quality improvement. The compiler effectively \"solves\" the alignment problem by eliminating everything that's hard to match.\n",

At O0, all 17 functions (including the duplicates) pass — the oracle correctly distinguishes them by CU/declaration. At O1, the small static helpers get inlined, and only `main` + 3 `run_module_*` wrappers remain eligible. The `run_module_*` functions fail with **NO_MATCH** (n_cand=4-5, overlap≈0.27-0.56) because the inlined static function code creates cross-TU confusion.\n",

    "\n",
    "At O1+, the `vec_*` functions get inlined and vanish from the eligible pool. The denominator shrinks from 18 → 3 → 2 → 2, and the yield % mechanically increases even though **the absolute HC count is dropping** (4 → 1 → 1 → 1).\n",
