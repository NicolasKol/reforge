    "oracle_pressure": "Functions intentionally exceed the nesting depth threshold (6+). Oracle must report DEEP_NESTING in uncertainty_flags and set WARN verdicts. Exercises every structural node type in the allowlist (compound_statement, if_statement, for_statement, while_statement, do_statement, switch_statement, return_statement, goto_statement, labeled_statement) within the same TU. Deep nesting interacts with compiler inlining and DWARF scope emission at higher optimization levels.",
